# Genome_GPT_Pipeline

ðŸ”± Genome GPT-Phoenixâ„¢ : Obscure Data Alignment Layer

Objective
Prepare genomic + phenotypic datasets for alignment into a unified schema, ensuring privacy and efficient query capabilities.

Datasets

1000 Genomes Project (VCF): genetic variants (genotype data).

GTEx (TSV matrices): gene expression across tissues.

PRIDE Proteomics (CSV): protein expression intensity values.

Pipeline Steps

Ingestion: Modular functions for parsing each dataset.

Harmonization: Standard schema â†’

Sample_ID | Data_Type | Gene/Protein | Expression/Variant | Metadata


Privacy Shielding:

SHA-256 hash of all Sample_IDs.

Removal of direct identifiers.

Alignment & Export:

Merge datasets into a single Parquet table.

Metadata included for tissue, sex, population, etc.

Example Query
Filter for liver tissue samples of African ancestry and inspect gene expression distribution:

result = query_data("genome_phoenix.parquet", {"tissue": "liver", "population": "AFR"})
print(result["Expression/Variant"].describe())


Expansion Possibilities

Integration with clinical phenotypes (UK Biobank).

Multi-omics layering (epigenomics, metabolomics).

Linkage with graph databases for variant-disease mapping.
